# A Dodgeball Game in Pygame

A first attempt at game development using the Pygame library as well as object-oriented programming. All of the textures were created in MS Paint and are stored in .png files. Fireballs spawn at the top of the screen at random intervals determined by the level of the game, and they are given a random directions (always toward the bottom of the screen) and randome velocities. Yellow coins will spawn also at random within the game area and the player can collect these coins for **10 points** each, after which a new coin will spawn immediately in a new position. If the player at any point leave the game area and enters the green sludge, the game will not end but they **will lose all of their points.** The game ends when the player collides with any of the fireballs. Scores are stored in a csv file in the format *score, id* where IDs are stored in retro fashion as three letter abreviations entered by the user at the time of achievement.
